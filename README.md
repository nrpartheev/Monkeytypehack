# Monkeytypehack
This is a automation of monkeytype using Tesseract (image to text convertion).. just for fun..


Please be careful if you have a large number in the 1st for loop you may be getting detected by the anticheat software.. 

Why use tesseract in place of selenium?

sometimes causes mistakes which will help in making the type look more human
